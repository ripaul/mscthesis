    abstract = "{Systems level modelling and simulations of biological processes are proving to be invaluable in obtaining a quantitative and dynamic perspective of various aspects of cellular function. In particular, constraint-based analyses of metabolic networks have gained considerable popularity for simulating cellular metabolism, of which flux balance analysis (FBA), is most widely used. Unlike mechanistic simulations that depend on accurate kinetic data, which are scarcely available, FBA is based on the principle of conservation of mass in a network, which utilizes the stoichiometric matrix and a biologically relevant objective function to identify optimal reaction flux distributions. FBA has been used to analyse genome-scale reconstructions of several organisms; it has also been used to analyse the effect of perturbations, such as gene deletions or drug inhibitions in silico. This article reviews the usefulness of FBA as a tool for gaining biological insights, advances in methodology enabling integration of regulatory information and thermodynamic constraints, and finally addresses the challenges that lie ahead. Various use scenarios and biological insights obtained from FBA, and applications in fields such metabolic engineering and drug target identification, are also discussed. Genome-scale constraint-based models have an immense potential for building and testing hypotheses, as well as to guide experimentation.}",

abstract = {Summary This chapter provides an introduction to the principles of the currently most advanced metabolic flux analysis (MFA) technique based on isotopic tracers (13C MFA). It focuses on 13C MFA method that extends classical stoichiometric MFA by using intracellular isotope labeling data as an additional source of measured information besides extracellular fluxes. The chapter concentrates on modeling and data analysis by using simple but highly instructive example networks, namely, the atom transition network and the isotopomer transition network. With these examples, the chapter discusses all steps of a typical 13C-MFA evaluation workflow. The qualitative viewpoint is now changed to a quantitative one by introducing isotopomer labeling balances describing the dynamics of all isotopomer fractions in the system. This dynamics is described by one differential equation per intermediate isotopomer pool in the network. Finally, the chapter provides a nontechnical overview of good practices as a guideline for choosing an appropriate software system.}

Fluxomics integrates in vivo measurements of metabolic fluxes with stoichiometric network models to allow the determination of absolute flux through large networks of the central carbon metabolism. There are many approaches to implement fluxomics including flux balance analysis (FBA), 13C fluxomics and 13C-constrained FBA as well as many experimental settings for flux measurement including dynamic, stationary and semi-stationary. Here we outline the principles of the different approaches and their relative advantages. We demonstrate the unique contribution of flux analysis for phenotype elucidation using a thoroughly studied metabolic reaction as a case study, the microbial aerobic/anaerobic shift, highlighting the importance of flux analysis as a single layer of data as well as interlaced in multi-omics studies.},

abstract={Recently, there has been an increasing interest in stoichiometric analysis of metabolic flux distributions. Flux balance methods only require information about metabolic reaction stoichiometry, metabolic requirements for growth, and the measurement of a few strain--specific parameters. This information determines the domain of stoichiometrically allowable flux distributions that may be taken to define a strain's ``metabolic genotype''. Within this domain a single flux distribution is sought based on assumed behavior, such as maximal growth rates. The optimal flux distributions are calculated using linear optimization and may be taken to represent the strain's ``metabolic phenotype'' under the particular conditions. This flux balance methodology allows the quantitative interpretation of metabolic physiology, gives an interpretation of experimental data, provides a guide to metabolic engineering, enables optimal medium formulation, and provides a method for bioprocess optimization. This spectrum of applications, and its ease of use, makes the metabolic flux balance model a potentially valuable approach for the design and optimization of bioprocesses.},

By explicitly considering experimental errors and in silico alternate optima in flux balance analysis, we systematically evaluate the capacity of 11 objective functions combined with eight adjustable constraints to predict (13)C-determined in vivo fluxes in Escherichia coli under six environmental conditions. While no single objective describes the flux states under all conditions, we identified two sets of objectives for biologically meaningful predictions without the need for further, potentially artificial constraints. Unlimited growth on glucose in oxygen or nitrate respiring batch cultures is best described by nonlinear maximization of the ATP yield per flux unit. Under nutrient scarcity in continuous cultures, in contrast, linear maximization of the overall ATP or biomass yields achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Since these particular objectives predict the system behavior without preconditioning of the network structure, the identified optimality principles reflect, to some extent, the evolutionary selection of metabolic network regulation that realizes the various flux states.},

    abstract = "{Advances in biological techniques have led to the availability of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for yeast. The size and complexity of such networks impose limits on what types of analyses one can perform. Constraint-based modelling overcomes some of these restrictions by using physicochemical constraints to describe the potential behaviour of an organism. FBA (flux balance analysis) highlights flux patterns through a network that serves to achieve a particular objective and requires a minimal amount of data to make quantitative inferences about network behaviour. Even though FBA is a powerful tool for system predictions, its general formulation sometimes results in unrealistic flux patterns. A typical example is fermentation in yeast: ethanol is produced during aerobic growth in excess glucose, but this pattern is not present in a typical FBA solution. In the present paper, we examine the issue of yeast fermentation against respiration during growth. We have studied a number of hypotheses from the modelling perspective, and novel formulations of the FBA approach have been tested. By making the observation that more respiration requires the synthesis of more mitochondria, an energy cost related to mitochondrial synthesis is added to the FBA formulation. Results, although still approximate, are closer to experimental observations than earlier FBA analyses, at least on the issue of fermentation.}",

abstract = "Macroscopic dynamical models of cell cultures in bioreactor are made of sets of ODEs representing the mass balances of the main macroscopic species (biomass, main substrates and metabolites). They can be coupled to a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) linear program whose solution gives metabolic flux values at each time instant. The linear constraints used in this linear program are made of positivity constraints for the fluxes, equalities which link the fluxes to simple macroscopic models of the substrate uptake rates and a set of equalities and inequalities corresponding to some biological assumptions. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to help defining this latter set of linear constraints, with a special focus on overflow metabolism description. It is shown how these linear constraints, together with the objective cost function to be used in the linear program, can be derived from a preliminary Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) and a careful comparison of the admissible metabolic flux intervals obtained either using both input and output flux measurements or using only input flux measurements. Finally, a method is proposed for estimating the dynamical model output uncertainties resulting from the intervals of admissible fluxes. In a case study made of hybridoma cell batch and fed-batch cultures, it is shown how to model overflow metabolism on both glucose and glutamine thanks to inequality constraints. The linear program corresponding to a FBA problem is then used in a macroscopic dynamical model which is able to reproduce biomass, substrates and metabolites concentration time profiles in direct and cross validation."

	abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.

abstract = {Abstract An optimization-based framework is introduced for testing whether experimental flux data are consistent with different hypothesized objective functions. Specifically, we examine whether the maximization of a weighted combination of fluxes can explain a set of observed experimental data. Coefficients of importance (CoIs) are identified that quantify the fraction of the additive contribution of a given flux to a fitness (objective) function with an optimization that can explain the experimental flux data. A high CoI value implies that the experimental flux data are consistent with the hypothesis that the corresponding flux is maximized by the network, whereas a low value implies the converse. This framework (i.e., ObjFind) is applied to both an aerobic and anaerobic set of Escherichia coli flux data derived from isotopomer analysis. Results reveal that the CoIs for both growth conditions are strikingly similar, even though the flux distributions for the two cases are quite different, which is consistent with the presence of a single metabolic objective driving the flux distributions in both cases. Interestingly, the CoI associated with a biomass production flux, complete with energy and reducing power requirements, assumes a value 9 and 15 times higher than the next largest coefficient for the aerobic and anaerobic cases, respectively. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The mathematical centerpiece of MFA is the solution of isotopomer labeling systems (ILS). An ILS is a high-dimensional nonlinear differential equation system that describes the distribution of isotopomers over a metabolic network during a carbon labeling experiment. This contribution presents a global analysis of the dynamic behavior of general ILSs. It is proven that an ILS is globally stable under very weak conditions that are always satisfied in practice. In particular it is shown that in some sense ILSs are a nonlinear extension to the classical theory of compartmental systems. The central stability condition for compartmental systems, i.e., the non-existence of traps in linear compartmental networks, is also the major stability condition for ILSs. As an important side result of the proof, it is shown that ILSs can be transformed to a cascade of linear systems with time-dependent inhomogeneous terms. This cascade structure has considerable consequences for the development of efficient numerical algorithms for the solution of ILSs and thus for MFA."

abstract={A cornerstone of biotechnology is the use of microorganisms for the efficient production of chemicals and the elimination of harmful waste. Pseudomonas putida is an archetype of such microbes due to its metabolic versatility, stress resistance, amenability to genetic modifications, and vast potential for environmental and industrial applications. To address both the elucidation of the metabolic wiring in P. putida and its uses in biocatalysis, in particular for the production of non-growth-related biochemicals, we developed and present here a genome-scale constraint-based model of the metabolism of P. putida KT2440. Network reconstruction and flux balance analysis (FBA) enabled definition of the structure of the metabolic network, identification of knowledge gaps, and pin-pointing of essential metabolic functions, facilitating thereby the refinement of gene annotations. FBA and flux variability analysis were used to analyze the properties, potential, and limits of the model. These analyses allowed identification, under various conditions, of key features of metabolism such as growth yield, resource distribution, network robustness, and gene essentiality. The model was validated with data from continuous cell cultures, high-throughput phenotyping data, (13)C-measurement of internal flux distributions, and specifically generated knock-out mutants. Auxotrophy was correctly predicted in 75{\%} of the cases. These systematic analyses revealed that the metabolic network structure is the main factor determining the accuracy of predictions, whereas biomass composition has negligible influence. Finally, we drew on the model to devise metabolic engineering strategies to improve production of polyhydroxyalkanoates, a class of biotechnologically useful compounds whose synthesis is not coupled to cell survival. The solidly validated model yields valuable insights into genotype-phenotype relationships and provides a sound framework to explore this versatile bacterium and to capitalize on its vast biotechnological potential.},

This chapter discusses several industrial fermentation examples. The methodologies used in metabolic engineering and the challenges and approaches complementary to metabolic engineering for industrial strain and bioprocess development are also discussed in the chapter. Classical metabolic engineering changes cell metabolism by changing its pathway enzyme(s) or regulatory protein(s) using recombinant DNA technology, thus improving the productivity and yield of an industrial fermentation product or producing novel biochemical compounds. However, classical metabolic engineering rarely considers gene regulation, and it is thus difficult to guide the selection of target genes for modification. Inverse metabolic engineering takes advantage of the knowledge learned from mutants or existing strains with improved performance. Functional genomics using high-throughput approaches provides more efficient metabolic engineering design and analysis, but still has limitations. Cellular metabolism and phenotypes are strongly influenced by the growth environment and thus can be manipulated by changing the medium composition or process conditions. Therefore, interactions between cells and the environment should not be overlooked in metabolic engineering. Functional genomics is currently the most effective approach for increasing knowledge at the molecular level of metabolic and adaptive processes in cells, and has become a new scientific field providing powerful tools for unraveling and understanding biological complexity."

ABSTRACT={<sup>13</sup>C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is the method of choice when a detailed inference of intracellular metabolic fluxes in living organisms under metabolic quasi-steady state conditions is desired. Being continuously developed since two decades, the technology made major contributions to the quantitative characterization of organisms in all fields of biotechnology and health-related research. <sup>13</sup>C MFA, however, stands out from other “-omics sciences,” in that it requires not only experimental-analytical data, but also mathematical models and a computational toolset to infer the quantities of interest, i.e., the metabolic fluxes. At present, these models cannot be conveniently exchanged between different labs. Here, we present the implementation-independent model description language FluxML for specifying <sup>13</sup>C MFA models. The core of FluxML captures the metabolic reaction network together with atom mappings, constraints on the model parameters, and the wealth of data configurations. In particular, we describe the governing design processes that shaped the FluxML language. We demonstrate the utility of FluxML to represent many contemporary experimental-analytical requirements in the field of <sup>13</sup>C MFA. The major aim of FluxML is to offer a sound, open, and future-proof language to unambiguously express and conserve all the necessary information for model re-use, exchange, and comparison. Along with FluxML, several powerful computational tools are supplied for easy handling, but also to maintain a maximum of flexibility. Altogether, the FluxML collection is an “all-around carefree package” for <sup>13</sup>C MFA modelers. We believe that FluxML improves scientific productivity as well as transparency and therewith contributes to the efficiency and reproducibility of computational modeling efforts in the field of <sup>13</sup>C MFA.}

abstract = "The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger is used extensively for the production of enzymes and organic acids. A major problem in industrial fermentations with this fungus is to ensure sufficient supply of oxygen required for respiratory metabolism of the fungus. In case of oxygen limitation, the fungus will produce various by-products like organic acids and polyols. In order to circumvent this problem we here study the effects of the expression of a bacterial hemoglobin protein on the metabolism of A. niger. We integrated the vgb gene from Vitreoscilla sp. into the genome at the pyrA locus behind the strong gpdA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans. Analysis of secreted metabolites, oxygen uptake, CO2 evolution and biomass formation points towards a relief of stress in the mutant expressing VHB when it is exposed to oxygen limitation. Our findings therefore point to an interesting strategy to attenuate unwanted side effects resulting from oxygen limitation during industrial fermentations with A. niger."

Several groups have demonstrated the feasibility of manipulating microbes to produce molecules similar to petroleum-derived products, albeit at relatively low productivity (e.g. maximum butanol production is around 20g/L). For cost-effective production of biofuels, the fuel-producing hosts and pathways must be engineered and optimized. Advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology will provide new tools for metabolic engineers to better understand how to rewire the cell in order to create the desired phenotypes for the production of economically viable biofuels."

ABSTRACT = {Metabolic engineering of various industrial microorganisms to produce chemicals, fuels, and drugs has raised interest since it is environmentally friendly, sustainable, and independent of nonrenewable resources. However, microbial metabolism is so complex that only a few metabolic engineering efforts have been able to achieve a satisfactory yield, titer or productivity of the target chemicals for industrial commercialization. In order to overcome this challenge, 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C-MFA) has been continuously developed and widely applied to rigorously investigate cell metabolism and quantify the carbon flux distribution in central metabolic pathways. In the past decade, many 13C-MFA studies have been performed in academic labs and biotechnology industries to pinpoint key issues related to microbe-based chemical production. Insightful information about the metabolic rewiring has been provided to guide the development of the appropriate metabolic engineering strategies for improving the biochemical production. In this review, we will introduce the basics of 13C-MFA and illustrate how 13C-MFA has been applied via integration with metabolic engineering to identify and tackle the rate-limiting steps in biochemical production for various host microorganisms},

ABSTRACT={The fate of plastic waste and a sustainable use of synthetic polymers is one of the major challenges of the twenty first century. Waste valorization strategies can contribute to the solution of this problem. Besides chemical recycling, biological degradation could be a promising tool. Among the high diversity of synthetic polymers, polyurethanes are widely used as foams and insulation materials. In order to examine bacterial biodegradability of polyurethanes, a soil bacterium was isolated from a site rich in brittle plastic waste. The strain, identified as Pseudomonas sp. by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and membrane fatty acid profile, was able to grow on a PU-diol solution, a polyurethane oligomer, as the sole source of carbon and energy. In addition, the strain was able to use 2,4-diaminotoluene, a common precursor and putative degradation intermediate of polyurethanes, respectively, as sole source of energy, carbon, and nitrogen. Whole genome sequencing of the strain revealed the presence of numerus catabolic genes for aromatic compounds. Growth on potential intermediates of 2,4-diaminotoluene degradation, other aromatic growth substrates and a comparison with a protein data base of oxygenases present in the genome, led to the proposal of a degradation pathway.}

abstract = {The problem of efficiently generating general multivariate densities via a Monte Carlo procedure has experienced dramatic progress in recent years through the device of a Markov chain sampler. This procedure produces a sequence of random deviates corresponding to a random walk over the support of the target distribution. Under certain regularity conditions, the corresponding Markov chain converges in distribution to the target distribution. Thus the sample of points so generated can serve as a statistical sample of points drawn from the target distribution. A random walk that can globally reach across the support of the distribution in one step is called a Hit-and-Run sampler. Hit-and-Run Markov chain samplers offer the promise of faster convergence to the target distribution than conventional small step random walks. Applications to optimization are considered.},

In particular, we use the neural network to substitute derivative calculations made during a Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) step with inexpensive neural network evaluations. Using a complex, high-dimensional blood coagulation model and a set of measurements, we define a likelihood function on which we evaluate the new MCMC algorithm. The blood coagulation model is a dynamic model, where derivative calculations are expensive and hence limit the efficiency of derivative-based MCMC algorithms. The MALA adaptation greatly reduces the time per iteration, while only slightly affecting the sample quality. We also test the new algorithm on a 2-dimensional example with a non-convex shape, a case where the MALA algorithm has a clear advantage over other state of the art MCMC algorithms. To assess the impact of the new algorithm, we compare the results to previously generated results of the MALA and the random walk Metropolis Hastings (RWMH).},
