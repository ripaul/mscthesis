 abstract = {Summary.  The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis–Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

Applications include nonredundant constraint identification, global optimization, and Monte Carlo integration. These algorithms are reversible random walks that commonly incorporate uniformly distributed step directions. We investigate nonuniform direction choice and show that, under regularity conditions on the region S and target distribution G, there exists a unique direction choice distribution, characterized by necessary and sufficient conditions depending on S and G, which optimizes the Doob bound on rate of convergence. We include computational results demonstrating greatly accelerated convergence for this optimizing direction choice as well as for more easily implemented adaptive heuristic rules.},

 abstract = {Quadratic models of objective functions are highly useful in many optimization algorithms. They are updated regularly to include new information about the objective function, such as the difference between two gradient vectors. We consider the case, however, when each model interpolates some function values, so an update is required when a new function value replaces an old one. We let the number of interpolation conditions, m say, be such that there is freedom in each new quadratic model that is taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the second derivative matrix of the change to the model. This variational problem is expressed as the solution of an (m+n+1)×(m+n+1) system of linear equations, where n is the number of variables of the objective function. Further, the inverse of the matrix of the system provides the coefficients of quadratic Lagrange functions of the current interpolation problem. A method is presented for updating all these coefficients in (\m+n\2) operations, which allows the model to be updated too. An extension to the method is also described that suppresses the constant terms of the Lagrange functions. These techniques have a useful stability property that is investigated in some numerical experiments.},

 abstract = {Modern biology abounds with questions on cell
characterization, such as genetic and molecular composition
and metabolic regulation. To elucidate these questions, the
experimentation computation cycle is used, where on one side
of the cycle, data is generated in experiments and on the
other side, data analysis is used to draw conclusions from
the data. In this thesis, we use Bayesian statistics to
address data analysis challenges in the characterization of
cells. In particular, we address the inference of
intracellular metabolic reaction rates (fluxes) from
measurements of 13C enrichments in metabolites (fluxomics)
and cell lineage reconstruction from time lapse microscopy
images of cell colonies. In both cases, the focus of the
work lies on challenges where some entities, central to the
data analysis, remain non-determined by the data. In the
fluxomics case, this means that the data is insufficient for
determining a unique metabolic network model, and in the
single-cell analysis case that the images are insufficient
for reconstructing the cell lineage with certainty. Apart
from deriving the appropriate statistical formalisms for
addressing the above challenges, computational strategies
for performing the practical calculations are proposed. For
the fluxomics calculations, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
for single model challenges and a Reversible Jump Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method for challenges with model
uncertainty are developed, tailored for the typically
linearly constrained spaces of flux parameters. For handling
uncertainty in cell lineage reconstruction, a particle
filtering approach is developed.},
